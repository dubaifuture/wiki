**Step 3 - Submit application**   | Once you have submitted the application, the review will take approximately 30 days.

If you are currently residing within the UAE, you will be given a temporary one-month visa, and will be required to convert your temporary visa into the residency permit during this period. In both cases, you can convert your one- or six-month visas into the residency quickly and conveniently at SERVICES 1 in Emirates Towers, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; or, directly through the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship.   |
