Once your nomination has been approved, you will be invited to apply for the visa through the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship.*

  *Once your nomination has been approved, you will be invited to complete the application for the visa through the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship website. Once completed, you will receive an email with further instructions on how to receive your visa. If you are currently residing outside of the UAE, you will be given a six-month visa to enter the UAE, explore the opportunities, and settle. During this period, you will be required to convert your temporary visa into the residency permit. If you are currently residing within the UAE, you will be given a temporary one-month visa, and will be required to convert your temporary visa into the residency permit during this period. In both cases, you can convert your one- or six-month visas into the residency quickly and conveniently at SERVICES 1 in Emirates Towers, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; or, directly through the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship.*
