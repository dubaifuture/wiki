## WELCOME <br>

The Regulations Lab (RegLab) is a step change in the legislation and application of emerging technologies. Instead of asking the traditional question of “how might we get government to keep up with the incredible pace of change imposed by new technologies?” we ask the question “how might we design government for change?”

RegLab is a revolutionary approach on behalf of the UAE in the legislation and application of emerging technologies. We work with regulators, the private sector, innovators and business leaders to co-create legislation that is in step with the speed of innovation. Regulations passed too early may stifle new innovations, while those that come too late may have already allowed negative impact on people and markets. That is why RegLab works in the regulation space to align regulation speed with innovation speed.

RegLab was launched in January 2019 in partnership with Dubai Future Foundation, as part of the UAE’s pathway to becoming a global innovation incubator and a testing ground for future technologies and their applications shaping human life and activity in the future such as mobility, health, 3D printing, AI and more.  

RegLab aims to create an agile and conducive legislative environment that pioneers “regulation innovation” as we develop new or existing legislation around emerging technologies in line with UAE's Centennial 2071 plan.
